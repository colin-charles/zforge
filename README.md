## What is zforge?

`zforge` is a command-line tool for AgentZero skill developers. It helps you:

- 🏗️ **Scaffold** new skills from a standard template
- ✅ **Validate** skills against the AgentZero SKILL.md standard
- 📦 **Build** distributable skill packages
- 🚀 **Publish** skills to the ZeroForge marketplace
- 🧪 **Test** skill behaviour before release

## Installation

```bash
pip install zforge
```

Or use the one-liner:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zero-forge.org/install.sh | bash
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new skill
zforge new my-skill

# Validate your skill
zforge validate --skill my-skill/

# Build a distributable package
zforge build --skill my-skill/

# Publish to ZeroForge marketplace
zforge publish my-skill/
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `zforge new <name>` | Scaffold a new skill from template |
| `zforge validate --skill <dir>` | Validate skill against SKILL.md standard |
| `zforge build --skill <dir>` | Build a `.zip` skill package |
| `zforge publish <dir>` | Publish skill to ZeroForge marketplace |
| `zforge test <dir>` | Run skill tests |
| `zforge hello` | Verify installation and show usage |


## How Certification Works

When you run `zforge publish`, the CLI automatically evaluates your skill quality using the **APOL pipeline** — an LLM-based judge that scores your `SKILL.md` across four dimensions:

| KPI | What is checked | Weight |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| Task Specificity | Are tasks described with precise, actionable detail? | High |
| Example Quality | Are examples concrete, realistic, and complete? | High |
| Scope Accuracy | Does the skill do what it says — no more, no less? | Medium |
| Submission Ready | Is the skill ready for production use? | Gate |

### The publish flow

```
zforge publish my-skill/
  │
  ├── Structural validation (required fields/sections)
  │
  ├── APOL quality scoring
  │     └── Score ≥ 0.80  →  CERTIFIED badge ✅  published immediately
  │
  └── Score < 0.80  →  You choose:

        A) Publish now as UNCERTIFIED
        B) Run APOL improvement pipeline

             B → LLM refines documentation (intent preserved)
               → Shows diff before overwriting
               → You confirm [Y/N]
               → Score ≥ 0.80 → CERTIFIED ✅
```

> **Your intent is always protected.** The APOL pipeline only improves *how* your skill is documented — never *what* it does. You review every change before it is saved.

### What CERTIFIED means

A **CERTIFIED** badge means the skill was independently scored at ≥ 0.80 by the APOL LLM judge. It is a quality signal, not just a compliance check.

An **UNCERTIFIED** skill is structurally valid and usable — it just hasn't passed the quality threshold yet.

## Using as an AgentZero Skill

`zforge` ships as an installable AgentZero skill. To install it inside Agent Zero:

```
Install the zforge skill from zero-forge.org/start
```

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the full Agent Zero skill instructions.
